requirejs-angular-starter
=========================

This repository is a starting place for building large scale [angular.js](http://angularjs.org) applications with [require.js](http://requirejs.org).

To get started, clone or fork the repo and use it as your starting place!

### Build
To create a build of your app, first install node, and then run...

```bash
npm install -g require.js
```

Then run,

```bash
r.js -o app.build.js
```

This will create a `/dist` folder with the built app.

**Note: the dist folder is included in this repository, but you may want to add `dist` to your `.gitignore` to keep it out of git**
